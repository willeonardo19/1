 * Blink

 *

 * The basic Arduino example.  Turns on an LED on for one second,

 * then off for one second, and so on...  We use pin 13 because,

 * depending on your Arduino board, it has either a built-in LED

 * or a built-in resistor so that you need only an LED.

  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);      // sets the digital pin as output

  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
